# MAGD 150 Projects

## Project 05
  In this project, I made a television setup that made use of interactive buttons. These buttons were made from two different shapes, a circle and a rectangle. Also, text was displayed to tell what each button does and this was placed on these buttons.
## Project 02
 For this project, I made balloons of different shapes and colors. At the same time, I made use of other shape modes and same goes for the different color modes. The color modes I made use of for the project were RGB, HSB, and Hexadecimal. Also, It used shapes like a 
Triangle, Quad, and Bezier.
## Project 03
  The project shown is a active screensaver and made from key features in Processing. First, it used width and height to help locate the shape in the program. Also, mouseX and mouseY were used help to make the shape interactive with mouse movement. In addition, the dist and map commands were used to help produce the color change based on distance from the center.  
## Project 06
  This project is a thunder cloud with rain that I made. The main tool that I used in this was the idea of methods to create objects and avoiding the mess of code in the main tab. The methods I used was for the cloud, another was used to make the lighting, and the last method was to create raindrops. 
## Project 09
  Finally, Project 9 was focused around the idea of taking usage of image, sound, and video. For this one, I made a mini showcase of a car with television static at the beginning. For the TV static, I used the image of the static and the sound was produced by using the Whitenoise command. This was timed seconds before playing the MP4 of a Mercedes. Finally, music was played at the same time the video starts.
